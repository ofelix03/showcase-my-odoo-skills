# What's this repo about?
Well, many of the Odoo projects I have worked on have been properiatary and therefore I'm unallowed to share them openly with other prospective client/employer.

This repository hence contains only 3 modules I'm able to share to hightlight my technical skills and experience in the design and development of custom and third-party integration solutions using the Odoo ERP Framework. 

# What's in this repo?

## Modules
Inside the `modules` directory are 3 custom modules I have built that covers many of the essential features of the Odoo ERP framework, including models, reports, email templates, wizards, crons and many more.

### 1. Order Management System (`oms`)

This is a productionize module that currently provides an end-to-end sales order placement
and fulfilment solution to a recognized Oil & Gas company in Ghana. Module enable a
streamlined, and efficient collaboration between the Trading, Marketing, Operations,
Accounting and Credit Control departments in performing their individual yet intertwined
operations within a sales placement and fulfilment process. Module introduced automation of
manual activities carried out by the various departments in this end-to-end process, and
thereby cut down the overall time and commitment to receiving and fulfilling order
placements.

The various department noticed a massive improvements in their respective areas of operations.

**Marketing:** they experienced increased and better visibility into customers’ order placements which in turned improved followup
communications and updates with their customers.

**Trading:** module provided them a simplified tool to manage the pricing and margin related information on orders placed into the system.

**Accounting:** they no more had a drudgery and error-prone data entry; easy and fast
generation of Sale Orders directly from OMS Loads, a simplified Stock Delivery and Invoice
generation.

**Credit Control:** provided the department an auto-credit approval feature which automatically approved customer orders based on pre-defined credit approval rules. This saved the department time to focus on other important aspectives of their everyday operations.

**Operations:** increased visibility on incoming orders that must be fulfilled at thedepot. They gave the operations team a better sense of expected workload and also estimate fulfilment time.


### 2. Account Payment Plan

Module enabled the management of customer payment plans. The module had integration
with other custom Odoo modules such as Acounting, Invoice Interest module. Modules
reduced manual creation of customer payment plans, and provided the Credit Control
department visibility on customers’ defaulting payment schedules. This allow them act
promptly and strategically through followups with the customer.

### 3. Account Invoice Interest

Module forms part of a Debt Recovery Suit which provides the Credit Control department the
tools to manage their customer debts. Module is used primarily by the Credit Control
department to monitor, and automate the accrual of daily interest on overdue customer
invoices. Module introduced efficiency and visibility to their receivable accounts and followup
and debt collection strategies.


## Videos
The `videos` directory contains 3 videos, one for each of the modules. Each video shows the original commit history of the modules.

For each video, my name *Felix Otoo* and email address *ofelix003@gmail.com* can be seen in all the commits in the commit history of every module, which should be enough proof of my authorship of these modules.

*When watching the videos, don't hesitate to increase the video's playpack speed to save yourself some time.*
